Here are my thoughts, add yours and/or comment on these:

We need an approach that:

●	can adapt to the needs of the teacher’s/program’s unique situation
●	is focused on best practices for learning the individual instrument
●	is concept-based so directors can build their method with the balance of concepts that match their approach
●	makes relevant connections between music, other art forms, and other domains
●	is not dependent on “page turning” as a means of progressing. Units can be constructed by drawing upon the various concept sections
●	covers all aspects of musicianship, including:
○	Music literacy
○	Ear Training
○	Mechanics/Technique
○	Music history
○	Instrument assembly, care, function
○	Creativity through performance
●	draws upon the expertise of current practitioners who know the craft and therefore know what their students need in order to succeed.
●	Is extensible (three-ring binders, tablets, etc.)
